    "__JSON__ is a _serialization format_. That is, JSON is a way of representing structured data in the form of a textual string.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __Python Dictionary__ is a _data structure_. That is, it is a way of storing data in memory that provides certain abilities to the code: in the case of dictionaries, those abilities include rapid lookup and enumeration.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to convert between the two by importing the JSON library: `import json`. Full documentation of JSON-Python interoperability and usage is available in [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `json.dumps()` method to serialize a dictionary as a JSON string. Use the `json.loads()` to import a JSON file and convert it into a dictionary. But the two are not the same: dictionaries are for working with data in your program, and JSON is for storing it or sending it around between programs.\n",
